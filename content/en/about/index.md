My name is Redwan Benmansour and I'm a student in Electrical Engineering and Industrial Computing (GEII). Technology has always been a passion for me. This passion is fueled not only by my curiosity, but above all by my desire to help others and improve people's lives.

### IUT de l'Indre : Châteauroux site
I grew up in Châteauroux, a small town where I was lucky enough to find the IUT de l'Indre. I've known about this IUT since I was a kid, going there every year for the Fête de la Science. I would discover the projects and innovations of the students and teacher-researchers in the GEII department.

The proximity of the IUT de l'Indre was a considerable advantage, both because of the small size of the classes and the closeness of the teaching staff. Thanks to this, I was able to develop my skills and become more professional through ambitious group projects. Above all, the IUT de l'Indre is a place where all three years of GEII students help each other and work together. It's in this spirit that I'd like to continue my higher education.

### A curriculum in line with my vision of the world
Today's environmental issues are a huge challenge facing our generation. The EME program enables me to specialize in renewable energies and techniques for improving energy efficiency. Various projects enable us to develop our skills. These have included the installation of a photovoltaic shade structure and the study of an active filtering system. We're learning how to develop and install these systems, based on real-life cases and using a wide range of professional equipment. You'll find highlights of these projects on this blog.

This career path has enabled me to develop my technical skills in harmony with my personal project, which is to deal with climate and energy issues by providing concrete technical solutions. It's true that the climate situation is distressing, but seeing what the scientific community is capable of doing is reassuring and gives us hope, particularly through projects such as the ITER nuclear fusion reactor. We have the power to change things and contribute to a better world.

### Sport at the heart of my studies
My place of study also allows me to take part in sporting activities, such as swimming at the Balsan'eo aquatic center. For me, sport is a very important activity in balancing my mental workload; it allows me to take a break to better deal with certain projects or jobs. Sport also simply keeps me in good physical health. 

Other student events, such as the ski trip, are organized every year and help to bring groups together through sporting activities. For many students, the ski trip is also an opportunity to discover the magnificent scenery of the Alps.
