My name is Redwan Benmansour and I'm a student in Electrical Engineering and Industrial Computing (GEII). 

### IUT de Nice
Je m’appelle Alexandre Pichot et j’ai suivi un DUT GEII à l’IUT de Nice. Passionné depuis longtemps par l’électricité, l’automatisation et l’informatique industrielle, ce cursus m’a permis d’acquérir des bases solides et de m’épanouir à travers des projets concrets et collaboratifs.

### A curriculum in line with my vision of the world
Today's environmental issues are a huge challenge facing our generation. The EME program enables me to specialize in renewable energies and techniques for improving energy efficiency. Various projects enable us to develop our skills. These have included the installation of a photovoltaic shade structure and the study of an active filtering system. We're learning how to develop and install these systems, based on real-life cases and using a wide range of professional equipment. You'll find highlights of these projects on this blog.

This career path has enabled me to develop my technical skills in harmony with my personal project, which is to deal with climate and energy issues by providing concrete technical solutions. 

### A passion for home automation
One of my greatest passions is home automation. It's the art of integrating automation and energy concepts into our living spaces. I regularly work with Home Assistant, and most of my personal projects involve it. For me, it's an opportunity to learn new concepts and handle technologies such as the Zigbee and MQTT protocols. Combined with industry, energy and home automation, the IoT is a powerful tool for developing new solutions.

### Sport at the heart of my studies
My place of study also allows me to take part in sporting activities, such as swimming at the Balsan'eo aquatic center. For me, sport is a very important activity in balancing my mental workload; it allows me to take a break to better deal with certain projects or jobs. Sport also simply keeps me in good physical health. 

Other student events, such as the ski trip, are organized every year and help to bring groups together through sporting activities. For many students, the ski trip is also an opportunity to discover the magnificent scenery of the Alps.
