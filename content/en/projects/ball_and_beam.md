### The "Ball and Beam" project of two GEII students
The two GEII students from the Indre IUT staked their chances on their Ball and Beam project. First of all, they had to build a ball position control model (see photo opposite). The material part of the model was produced using teaching aids from the IUT de l'Indre. 3D printing was used to speed up delivery times and keep costs down. On the other hand, the software for the model was provided by MATLAB Simulink software, compatible with their Arduino Mega 2650 microcontroller.
